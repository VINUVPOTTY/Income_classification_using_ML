# Income_classification_using_ML
This project aims to predict whether an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold (commonly $50K) based on features such as education, work class, occupation, and others. We approach this as a binary classification problem using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
